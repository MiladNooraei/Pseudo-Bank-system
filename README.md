Implementing a simple bank system and saving all reports in a text file
## Description

In this project, I have implemented a simple bank system that tracks actions and generates a report in a text file. The system allows two types of users: Bank Employees and Bank Customers.

### Bank Employee Actions:

1. Open an account for a customer
2. Find an account
3. Deposit money for a customer
4. Withdraw money for a customer

Bank employees can open new accounts for customers, find existing accounts, deposit money into a customer's account, and withdraw money from a customer's account.

### Bank Customer Actions:

1. Deposit money
2. Withdraw money
3. Ask for a loan

Bank customers can deposit and withdraw money from their own accounts, as well as request a loan from the bank.

## Reporting

All actions performed within the bank system are recorded and reported in a text file. The generated report contains details of each action, such as the type of action, the user who performed the action (employee or customer), and any relevant information associated with the action.
